                - and should I senf the user id or not ? I think of course yes
                - What the struture for the post server need ?

- Archive List : 
                - I will send the user id & post id 
                - should add the post to the archive list  
                - expected to return the new active posts to renerder the page 



Bugs: 

-Case 1:

problem: in company home page, the server return all the Posts in the database
should do : return just the company posts 
client side : send the user id succesfully 
expect : company posts BUT the server return all the posts 
And : We need to be an active post list & archive post list || I should make something in the client
        becs we need to check if the post in the archive or not before show it in the home posts company page
Sol: return the array of posts id for the archive and check if the original array don't have this post in the archive put it in the new array and if exist don't then show the new array ( return it from the action or reducer)
